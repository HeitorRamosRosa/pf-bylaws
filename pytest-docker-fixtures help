#Hello, I am sorry to reach you in this way but Github does not allow direct messages.
#I am trying to use pytest-docker-fixtures because of kafka support.
#I am having trouble using kafka with the package (other images run fine).
#In pytest-docker-fixtures's docs I saw that in version 1.2.5 {(2018-11-13) Add support for Kafka [ableeb]} kafka was added.
#Was it you?
#If yes, would you be able to help me?
#If yes please contact me at heitorramosrosa@gmail.com
#If no it is ok :)

#If the adleeb that made the version 1.2.5 is not you I am sorry for the trouble, delete this file :D
